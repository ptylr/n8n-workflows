# üß† n8n Workflows by @ptylr
Welcome to the public repository of n8n workflows created and shared by [@ptylr](https://n8n.io/creators/ptylr/) ‚Äî a space to collaborate, learn, and accelerate your automation projects.

## üîç About This Repository

This repository is a collection of ready-to-use [n8n](https://n8n.io) workflow exports designed to tackle real-world tasks across marketing, operations, integrations, and data flows. Each file is a JSON export straight from the n8n editor.

I created this repository to:

- Share workflows that others might find useful or inspiring
- Document my automation experiments and best practices
- Provide a resource for the broader n8n community
- Save time for others by solving common challenges once

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

1. **Find a Workflow**  
   Browse the repository for a `.json` file that meets your needs. Each file represents one complete n8n workflow.

2. **Import into Your n8n Instance**
    - Open your local or hosted n8n environment
    - Go to the editor view and click on the menu icon (three dots in the top-right corner)
    - Select **Import from file** and upload the `.json` file you downloaded

3. **Configure Credentials & Settings**  
   The workflow will import with placeholder credentials and environment-specific variables. Before running:
    - Add or configure the required credentials (API keys, OAuth2, etc.)
    - Adjust environment variables, paths, or endpoint URLs as necessary
    - Review nodes for any hard-coded or user-specific data

4. **Test & Deploy**  
   Make sure to test the workflow in a safe environment before deploying in production.
